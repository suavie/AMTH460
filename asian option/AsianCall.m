%  AsianCall  calculates  the  price  of  an  Asian  call  option  by  using
%  Monte  Carlo  simulation.  T  is  the  time  to  maturity,  
%Nsteps  is  the number  of  steps,   
%Nreps  is  the  number  of  times  a  path  and  a  price is  calculated,
%S0  is  the  initial  stock  price,  K  is  the  strike  price, %  
%r>=0  is  the  risk-free  interest  rate,  and  sigma  is  the  volatility
%  of  the  underlying  stock.
%  The  stock  path  is  calculated  as
%  S_t  =  S_0*exp(r-0.5*sigma^2+sigma*sqrt(t)*Z)
%  where  Z  is  N(0,1)
